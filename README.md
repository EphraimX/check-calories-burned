# An app to calculate calories burned during workout using Machine Learning and Flask.

This project predicts the number of calories burned during a workout session, based on inputs from the user. The inputs are Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration of Workout, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature.

The GradientBoostingRegressor is the algorithm used in this project to train the data.
The Model Score gotten when tested was 99.68% with a Mean Absolute Error of 2.61

The application is deployed on Heroku, using Flask. You can check it out [here](https://check-calories-burned.herokuapp.com/).
